# Benchmarks for typical Data Science I/O in Python

This is a collection of benchmarks that I use in my blog posts to measure
the performance of various I/O systems and their Python performance. These
benchmarks were executed on my personal MacBook with a
`Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8259U CPU @ 2.30GHz` and 16GiB of RAM. Each of the
benchmarks contains their own separate setup.
